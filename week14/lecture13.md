## Notes on Final, Part 3

Due dates:
 1. First draft of Part 3 -- due April 28, will get feedback course participants 
 1. Post your link in the Canvas forum to get feedback from classmates -- April 29
 1. Provide feedback for 3 randomly assigned classmates -- due May 5 
 1. Final chance to resubmit your Part 3 -- May 12 
 
**Please be aware these are hard deadlines -- no extensions available**
 
notes:
go to pages!!

because we have to get grades in by a certain time, these due dates are hard ones -- no extensions.

your "first" part 3 submission CAN be a work in progress -- you can outline what you want to do, but the more you have done, the better we can give you feedback and the more there is for your other feedback-giving classmates to work with

be aware that the due dates have shifted a little bit -- the first draft of your final part 3 has moved up, but the final submission has moved back -- this is so that you'll have plenty of time to get feedback and give feedback to others.
