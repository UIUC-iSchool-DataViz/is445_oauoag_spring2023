## Reminder: Change of Modalities Week 15 & 16

Weeks 15 & 16 will have some pre-recorded materials for the extra credit assignments (SciViz, Network Viz, Text Viz).

There will be short lectures and the rest of the time we'll have space to work on your Final Projects (as a group or in breakout groups).

notes:

we'll also "talk" more about this in Week 15 with some pre-recorded materials and an extra credit optional assignment on scientific viz

you can stay in the main room, or there will be breakout rooms for you as well!

**go over where EC assignments are!!**

## Notes on Final, Part 3

Due dates:
 1. First draft of Part 3 -- due April 28, will get feedback course participants (moved up)
 1. Post your link in the Canvas forum to get feedback from classmates -- April 29
 1. Provide feedback for 3 randomly assigned classmates -- due May 5 (moved back)
 1. Final chance to resubmit your Part 3 -- May 12 (moved back)
 
**Please be aware these are hard deadlines -- no extensions available**
 
notes:
go to pages!!

because we have to get grades in by a certain time, these due dates are hard ones -- no extensions.

your "first" part 3 submission CAN be a work in progress -- you can outline what you want to do, but the more you have done, the better we can give you feedback and the more there is for your other feedback-giving classmates to work with

be aware that the due dates have shifted a little bit -- the first draft of your final part 3 has moved up, but the final submission has moved back -- this is so that you'll have plenty of time to get feedback and give feedback to others.

## Final Project, Part 3

notes:

* go over
* should we push this back a few days (maybe that friday?)
